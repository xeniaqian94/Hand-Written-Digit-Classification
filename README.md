Two-class digit classification problem using  
1. logistic regression and the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN)  
2. Neural Network  
3. Mixture of Gaussian and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
Training data consist of hand-written digits of 3s and 8s from the MNIST database. 
Each digit is represented by a 28Ã—28 array of numbers and labeled as either 0 or 1.   

Three separate data sets: mnist38 train, mnist38 validate, mnist38 test, with 200, 100, and 100 data points, respectively.
